This is a farming game.
Player amount is 1-4. For each round you choose only 1 choice out of five 
available: buy animals, buy food, feed animals, mate animals,
sell animals. At the end of the game all animals from each user get sold
and user wins if he/she gets most money. If user does not have
neither money nor animals in any round, he/she gets eliminated.
The features that I chose to add:
  * If animal's age is more than it's max age, animal dies
  * Animals can get ill with 20% chance and if user does not pay
 for vet or if vet could not help a sick animal, animal dies.
